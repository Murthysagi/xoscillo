This is a multiplatform software oscilloscope and logical analyzer. It supports Arduino (with custom firmware) and a Parallax USB oscilloscope.

## Features
* Panoramic view 
* Load and save waveforms 
* Zoom in and out 
* Can open several waveforms at the same time 
* Can run several oscilloscopes/logical analyzers simultaneously 
* Frequency analysis using FFT 
* Filtering, so far it has a low pass filter, probably more to come. 
* Works on Windows and Linux (needs mono) 
* Autodetects the hardware 
* Post processing tools 
  * Decodes fsk waves 
  * Calculates wave main frequency using a few methods 

## Supported platforms
* Arduino 
* Parallax
